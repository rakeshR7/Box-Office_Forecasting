### Introduction
Forecasting box-office performance is one of the most important decisions that production houses and movie distributors are involved in before getting involved in a project. In this project, we study the movie data from 1997 to 2017, to help predicting the profitability of a movie at the box office based upon other variables including genre, rating, and release dates, etc. The example questions we would like to address are as follows:
1. Why do some small budgets films performed well, while some large budget films became box office bombs?
2. How do movies fare in terms of genre?
3. How well do remakes, tent-poles and sequels perform?
4. In the prediction model, which key variables should be considered and how they affect the profitability of a movie?
5. Does rating of a movie have any effect on box office?
6. As a movie production house, which Actors/Directors would they consider cast in a movie?
7. Does a plot of a movie affect its earning in any way?

To achieve the goals of this project, we will first clean the data, convert the Box Office numbers into categorical data. Then based upon the pre-processed data, we will build different models using different methods taught in the the class, such as random forest, k-nearest neighbors. We will compare these models and make a rationale choice of the best model. Finally, we will create graphical representation that reflects our findings from our analysis. By going throught this project, all team members will be involved in the whole process of data analysis, including preprocessing, modeling and visualization. As a result we will obtain an in-depth understanding of data-analysis and machine learning, thus be better prepared for future projects that require analyzing real-world data.
